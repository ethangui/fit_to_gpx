## Why Convert FIT to GPX?

FIT (Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer) is a binary file format used by Garmin, Wahoo, Suunto, and other fitness devices to store activity data. While FIT files can contain rich sensor data, they're not as widely supported as GPX files.

GPX (GPS Exchange Format) is an XML-based format that's supported by virtually all mapping and fitness tracking software. Converting to GPX allows you to:

- View your activities in a wider range of applications
- Share your routes more easily
- Manipulate the data with standard XML tools

## Limitations

This converter focuses on core GPS data and lap structure. It does not currently preserve:
- Heart rate data
- Cadence
- Power
- Other sensor metrics
